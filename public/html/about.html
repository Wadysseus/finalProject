                                <p>Hi, thanks for clicking on the ABOUT page.</p>
                                <p>This is my final project for RefactorU, I hope you enjoy it.</p>
                                <p>One guideline we were given to help us come up with ideas for apps was to try to think of a problem in our own lives we wanted solved. 
                                <p>I don't really have any big problems to solve, but I <b><i>do</i></b> go through a lot of ink and paper for role-playing games. See, I used to live in a big house full of gamers, and there'd always be character sheets on hand. We'd print out extras, because we knew they'd get used. </p>
                                <p>These days, everyone's scattered to the wind, and even if we do meet up and make characters, we usually end up playing for only a handful of sessions before life gets in the way. This means that there's a cabinet in my house that's basically a repository for aborted campaigns and characters.</p>
                                <p>Now, I figure, rather than continue to spend inordinate amounts of cash on the most expensive liquid on Earth, I'd save the planet and my pocketbook by creating a site that allows for easy digital record keeping for characters. There are a lot of good character <b><i>builder</i></b> sites out there, but not so many that allow you to retain a living document, something to replace the old "scratch sheet."</p>
